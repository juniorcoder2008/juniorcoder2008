# JuniorCoder
Hi! I'm Samuel Thomas aka. JuniorCoder, I'm 14 years old and I'm a German full stack developer (still unpaid of course). 🤖

I mainly program frontend apps, but I also know some backend stuff. I've been programming since I was 10 years old and love to develop new apps, from UI design to full code. I also work with frameworks like Angular, React or Svelte.

➔ Favorite languages: __Typescript & Python__ 👨🏼‍💻
